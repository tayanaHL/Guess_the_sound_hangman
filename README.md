# Guess_the_sound_hangman

Here we have a simple functional hangman game with a few adding components to make it unique.  Due to my interest in video games, I decided I'd incorporate older video game sounds that would give most people, incliuding myself, a nostalgic feeling.

Technolgies Used:
-HTML5
-CSS
-Javascript

-As a user, I want the ability to play the sounds and replay if needed.
-As a user, I want the ability to use "Need a Hint" for user assitance if needed
-As a user, I want the ability to play again when game ends, without having to refresh page or go back
